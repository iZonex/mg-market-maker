# Integration Test Coverage Matrix — Apr 19

> Sprint 15 R8.7. The audit in Sprint 14 found that E2E test gaps
> are where latent bugs hide (env-var drift across dashboard +
> evaluator would have been caught by one integration test). This
> doc enumerates every critical operator-visible path and marks
> what we've actually tested E2E vs relied on unit-level coverage.

## Scoring

- **✅ E2E** — integration test exercises the full producer →
  transport → consumer path; changing any link without updating
  the test breaks it.
- **🟡 Unit** — unit tests cover each link but not the glue
  between them; gate drift + inter-crate contract bugs can hide.
- **❌ None** — no test at all beyond compile-check.

## What the matrix tells us

Three clusters of weakness:

1. **HTTP-layer E2E is near-zero across the board.** Every
   endpoint has state-level or unit tests but no "client POSTs +
   expects response" integration test. A bug in axum routing,
   middleware ordering, or serde shape wouldn't be caught. Priority:
   wire a single Axum `TestClient` harness and hit the 6 highest-
   risk endpoints (rebalance/execute, manipulation/scores, deploy,
   logout, /metrics, /health).

2. **REST-poll paths on connectors (funding, OI, L/S ratio) have
   no E2E.** Unit tests for each impl exist but no test proves the
   engine's `refresh_funding_rate` poll → state → graph source loop
   works. Sprint 14 would have caught two bugs if we'd had it.
   Priority: mock connector + engine tick → verify state updates.

3. **Dashboard deploy handler has no env-var gate test.** This is
   exactly where Sprint 14's BUG #1 hid. Priority: add a handler
   unit test that sets `MM_ALLOW_RESTRICTED` both correctly and
   incorrectly, asserts 202 vs 403.

## Sprint 16+ backlog

- [x] **R10.2a** Axum TestClient harness (Sprint 16 —
  `crates/dashboard/tests/http_handlers_e2e.rs`)
- [x] **R10.2b** Top-6 endpoints hit via harness (Sprint 16)
- [x] **R10.2d** Dashboard deploy handler env-var gate test
  (Sprint 16 R11.3 —
  `restricted_env_gate_only_accepts_exact_literal`)
- [x] **R11.4** MockConnector fixture + REST-poll contract
  tests (Sprint 17 —
  `crates/exchange/core/tests/mock_connector_contracts.rs`).
  Pins default `Ok(None)` for `get_open_interest` +
  `get_long_short_ratio` on spot; override path for perps;
  `set_leverage` call recording + failure injection.
- [x] **R10.2c** Engine tick integration (Sprint 18 R12.2 +
  R12.3 — `refresh_funding_rate` + `spawn_leverage_setup`
  both proven end-to-end against mock connector)
- [ ] **R10.2e** Wire CI to run integration tests in addition
  to unit tests — currently `--lib` + `--tests` runs
  everything locally but we haven't verified the CI workflow
  picks up the new `tests/*.rs` files.
